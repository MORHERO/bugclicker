# bugclicker

Bugclicker is a js browser game inspired by cookieclicker and candybox.
The game is available at [bugclicker.morhero.de](https://bugclicker.morhero.de)

Currently bugclicker is in an early alpha state.

## Current TODOS:

- Reworking javascript ( like switching from prototypes to classes etc.)
- Fully removing jQuery!
- Switching from saving the game in files to a database.
- Clean up save data
- Adding micro animations
- Creating a better gameflow
